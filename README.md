# Delhi-NCR Housing Price Prediction

This project predicts housing prices in the Delhi-NCR region using machine learning techniques. It is based on the `Delhi.csv` dataset, which contains detailed information about properties in Delhi-NCR and was sourced from Kaggle.

## Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict the price of residential properties in Delhi-NCR using various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
- **Approach:** The project uses data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and several regression models (including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to build and evaluate predictive models.
- **Notebook:** All code and analysis are contained in the Jupyter notebook: `Delhi-NCR Housing Price Prediction.ipynb`.

## Dataset
- **File:** `Delhi.csv`
- **Source:** Kaggle
- **Description:** Contains property listings with features such as price, area, address, latitude, longitude, bedrooms, bathrooms, status, furnished status, type of building, and more.

## Requirements
Install the required Python packages with:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the project folder.
2. Ensure `Delhi.csv` is present in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open `Delhi-NCR Housing Price Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis, model training, and predictions.
