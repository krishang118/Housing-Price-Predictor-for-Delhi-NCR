# Delhi-NCR Housing Price Predictor

This project predicts housing prices in the Delhi-NCR region using machine learning techniques. It is based on the `Delhi.csv` dataset, which contains detailed information about properties in Delhi-NCR and was sourced from Kaggle.

## Overview
- **Goal:** We have to predict the price of residential properties in Delhi-NCR using various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.
- **Approach:** The project uses data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and several regression models (including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) to build and evaluate predictive models.

## Dataset
- **File:** `Delhi.csv`
- **Description:** Contains property listings with features such as price, area, address, latitude, longitude, bedrooms, bathrooms, status (of construction), furnished status, type of building, and more.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository on your local machine.
2. Run and execute the `Delhi-NCR Housing Price Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, with the `Delhi.csv` dataset file present in the same directory.
